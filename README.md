# Hi there, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer working mostly on the backend and with infrastructure. I also do a lot of recreational programming with graphics, data structures, command line tools, testing other languages and anything that piques my interest.

I work at [Sequential](https://www.gosequential.com/) working on backend, frontend, infra, and even helping out with deploying some Data Science magic.

Previously I worked on the [Cloud](https://acloudguru.com/) team at [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com), and at a few startups called [Lived](https://lived.app/), [Xplor](https://www.ourxplor.com/), [Sine](https://www.sine.co/), [Licorice](https://licorice.io/) among others.

## Tech

Here's a bunch of tech I use fairly regularly. It's not an exhaustive list, but it's a window into what I do.
