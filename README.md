# Hi there, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I work at a company called [Lived](https://lived.app) building a mobile app and cloud infrastructure to help people change their relationship with alcohol.

I love functional programming, and the original ideas of OOP, I also love playing with various languages and building things that have impact.

## Languages I like to play with in order of frequency

### JavaScript | TypeScript

</div>

I've been writing JavaScript for many years and it's basically a second language to me. It has it's quirks, but you gotta love how fast it is to work with.

TypeScript is my preferred "flavour" of JavaScript, though I also _really_ love [Elm]
(https://elm-lang.org/) too, just I don't have much application for it lately.
I use TypeScript a lot for defining AWS infrastructure with [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and writing serverless code.

### Dart for Flutter

I use Dart most days while building cross platform mobile apps.

### Elixir

Elixir is a functional, compiled language that that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM), and it's AWESOME! Easily

### Lua

</div>

Lua is such a cool, tiny yet powerful language. It's compiled (but has a super fast JIT compiler too) and is designed to be a scripting languages with great C interop. I find it really great fun for learning game development with [LÃ¶ve 2D](https://love2d.org/).

### Common Lisp

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Common Lisp (most Lisps really) is a fantastic language that's quickly steeling my heart to become my favourite. It's _super_ old, yet seems to have everything that newer languages shout about as "new" or "revolutionary" features. It fits the way I think about programming, and I'd love to use it more.

### Golang

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Go logo](lang-go-small.png "Go")

</div>

Go is a great language to just get stuff done concisely, and get it done _fast_. It's quick to spin up programs and they just work, kinda like Elixir in that respect though quite a different structure paradigm.
